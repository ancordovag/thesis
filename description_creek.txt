Problem Description. The task of this project is to solve a Creek puzzle using ASP.
The goal of the game is to to blacken some cells of a rectangular grid so that the following
conditions are met:
1. All white cells (non-blackened) must form an orthogonally connected area, i.e., it
must be possible to get from any white cell to any other white cell by moving only
horizontally and vertically (never diagonally!), and without having to cross a black
cell.
2. A number in a circle indicates how many of the 4 adjacent cells must be blackened.

One example is shown in gure 1. The left side shows a 6x4 grid with nine numbers given
in nodes. The right side shows a (here the unique) solution for the grid. Observe that the
number of blackened cells adjacent to the (nine) nodes corresponds to each given number,
and that all white cells are connected to each other. The Creek puzzle can also be tried
online at the following site: http://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Creek/index.htm
Representation in ASP. We represent the cells of a rectangular grid and the nodes
with numbers by facts of the following form:
cell(X,Y). % there is a cell with coordinates (X,Y)
hint(X,Y,N). % N of the (maximum four) cells at coordinates (X,Y),
%(X+1,Y), (X,Y+1) and (X+1,Y+1) must be blackened
For example, the grid shown on the left in Figure 1 left is described by the following facts:
cell(1..6,1..4).
hint(1,1,3). hint(2,2,2). hint(3,1,0). hint(4,2,1). hint(5,1,3).
hint(1,3,3). hint(2,3,1). hint(3,3,2). hint(5,3,3).
A solution, i.e. a set (of coordinates) of blackened cells, is represented by atoms of the
predicate black/2:
black(X,Y) % the cell at the coordinates (X,Y) is blackened
The solution shown on the right in gure 1 is described by the following atoms:
black(1,1) black(5,1) black(6,1)
black(1,2) black(2,2) black(6,2)
black(1,3) black(2,3) black(4,3) black(6,3)
black(1,4) black(4,4) black(5,4) black(6,4)
