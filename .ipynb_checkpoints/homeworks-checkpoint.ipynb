This means that there must be no gaps between the steps, i.e., if there is an atom at(X,Y,S) for S>0 then there must be an atom at(XX,YY,S-1) for some XX and YY.\\n\\n    \\n    Header 4:\\n    %% Header\\ntime(1..H) :- maxsteps(H).\\ndiff(1,0). diff(0,1). diff(-1,0). diff(0,-1).\\n\\n    Initialization 4:\\n    '"
