Given some categorized constants in the form "category: constant_1; constant_2; ...; constant_n" and some predicates about the
    relation among different categories of constants, write ASP (Answer Set Programming) rules to generate the search space of possible relations.
    
    Constants:
     employee: "Bonita"; "Yvette"; "Tabitha".
                    price: 225; 275; 325.
                    wood_type: "ash"; "poplar"; "sandalwood".    
                

    Predicates:
    
                    % The categories in Constants include employee, price, and wood_type. We use different variables E, P, and W to represent employee, price, and wood_type.
                    % We match an employee E with price P and wood type W, where E belongs to employee, P belongs to price, and W belongs to wood_type.
                    match(E, P, W)
                    

    ASP Rules:
    % Define the constants in each category.
    employee("Bonita"; "Yvette"; "Tabitha").
    price(225; 275; 325).
    wood_type("ash"; "poplar"; "sandalwood").
    % For each employee E, it matches with exactly 1 price P and 1 wood type W.
    {match(E, P, W): price(P), wood_type(W)}=1 :- employee(E).

    Constants: 
    object: "M"; "V"; "T"; "W".
                    position: "left"; "below and to the right"; "9:00". 
    
    Predicates: 
    % The categories in Constants include object and position. We use different variables O and P to represent object and position.
% We define the relation between object O and position P, where O belongs to object and P belongs to position.
relation(O, P) 
    
    ASP Rules: /n% Define the constants in each category.
object("M"; "V"; "T"; "W").
position("left"; "below and to the right"; "9:00").
% For each object O, it has exactly 1 position P.
{relation(O, P): position(P)}=1 :- object(O).
