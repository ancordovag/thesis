Given some categorized constants in the form "category: constant_1; constant_2; ...; constant_n" and some predicates about the
    relation among different categories of constants, write ASP (Answer Set Programming) rules to generate the search space of possible relations.
    
    Constants:
     employee: "Bonita"; "Yvette"; "Tabitha".
                    price: 225; 275; 325.
                    wood_type: "ash"; "poplar"; "sandalwood".    
                

    Predicates:
    
                    % The categories in Constants include employee, price, and wood_type. We use different variables E, P, and W to represent employee, price, and wood_type.
                    % We match an employee E with price P and wood type W, where E belongs to employee, P belongs to price, and W belongs to wood_type.
                    match(E, P, W)
                    

    ASP Rules:
    % Define the constants in each category.
    employee("Bonita"; "Yvette"; "Tabitha").
    price(225; 275; 325).
    wood_type("ash"; "poplar"; "sandalwood").
    % For each employee E, it matches with exactly 1 price P and 1 wood type W.
    {match(E, P, W): price(P), wood_type(W)}=1 :- employee(E).

    Constants: 
    person: "Roberta"; "Thelma"; "Steve"; "Pete".
                    job: "chef"; "guard"; "nurse"; "telephone operator"; "police officer"; "teacher"; "actor"; "boxer". 
    
    Predicates: 
    % The categories in Constants include person and job. We use different variables P and J to represent person and job.
% We assign a person P to a job J, where P belongs to person and J belongs to job.
assign(P, J) 
    
    ASP Rules: /n% Define the constants in each category.
person("Roberta"; "Thelma"; "Steve"; "Pete").
job("chef"; "guard"; "nurse"; "telephone operator"; "police officer"; "teacher"; "actor"; "boxer").
% For each person P, it is assigned to exactly 1 job J.
{assign(P, J): job(J)}=1 :- person(P).
