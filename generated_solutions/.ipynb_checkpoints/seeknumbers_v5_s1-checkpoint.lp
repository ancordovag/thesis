1. The path starts at the cell marked with a white circle:
   start(X, Y) :- white_circle(X, Y).

2. The path ends at the cell marked with a black circle:
   end(X, Y) :- black_circle(X, Y).

3. The path traverses each remaining cell of the square grid without ever crossing or intersecting itself:
   path(X, Y) :- cell(X, Y), not crossed(X, Y).

4. Between a cell with a number and the next cell with a number or the cell marked with a black circle, respectively, the path bends exactly as often as the number in the first cell indicates:
   bends(X, Y, N) :- number(X, Y, N), next_number_or_end(X, Y), count_bends(X, Y, N).

5. The path does not bend between the cell marked with a white circle and the first cell with a number:
   no_bend(X, Y) :- white_circle(X, Y), first_number(X, Y).

6. The path does not cross or intersect itself:
   not_crossed(X, Y) :- path(X, Y), not crossed(X, Y).

7. The path can only move horizontally or vertically to adjacent cells:
   move(X1, Y1, X2, Y2) :- path(X1, Y1), path(X2, Y2), adjacent(X1, Y1, X2, Y2).

8. The path cannot move diagonally:
   not_diagonal(X1, Y1, X2, Y2) :- path(X1, Y1), path(X2, Y2), diagonal(X1, Y1, X2, Y2).

9. The path cannot cross or intersect itself:
   crossed(X, Y) :- path(X, Y), path(X1, Y1), path(X2, Y2), path(X3, Y3), X != X1, Y != Y1, X != X2, Y != Y2, X != X3, Y != Y3, intersect(X, Y, X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3, Y3).

10. The path can only bend as many times as indicated by the number in the cell:
    count_bends(X, Y, N) :- number(X, Y, N), count_bends(X, Y, 0, N).

11. The path can only bend a maximum of N times:
    count_bends(X, Y, N, N) :- path(X, Y).
    count_bends(X, Y, M, N) :- path(X, Y), M < N, M1 = M + 1, count_bends(X, Y, M1, N).

12. Two cells are adjacent if they share a side:
    adjacent(X1, Y1, X2, Y2) :- path(X1, Y1), path(X2, Y2), (X1 = X2, abs(Y1 - Y2) = 1) ; (Y1 = Y2, abs(X1 - X2) = 1).

13. Two cells are diagonal if they share a corner:
    diagonal(X1, Y1, X2, Y2) :- path(X1, Y1), path(X2, Y2), abs(X1 - X2) = 1, abs(Y1 - Y2) = 1.

14. Two cells intersect if they share a common point:
    intersect(X, Y, X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3, Y3) :- path(X, Y), path(X1, Y1), path(X2, Y2), path(X3, Y3), (X = X1, Y = Y1) ; (X = X2, Y = Y2) ; (X = X3, Y = Y3).

15. The first number cell is the first cell encountered after the white circle:
    first_number(X, Y) :- white_circle(X1, Y1), path(X, Y), next_number_or_end(X1, Y1), not path(X2, Y2), adjacent(X1, Y1, X, Y).

16. The next number cell or end cell is the next cell encountered after a number cell:
    next_number_or_end(X, Y) :- number(X1, Y1, N), path(X, Y), not path(X2, Y2), adjacent(X1, Y1, X, Y).

Note: The above rules are just an example and may not cover all possible cases or constraints of the given problem. Additional rules may be required depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem.1. The path cannot start at a cell that is not marked with a white circle:
   :- start(X, Y), not white_circle(X, Y).

2. The path cannot end at a cell that is not marked with a black circle:
   :- end(X, Y), not black_circle(X, Y).

3. The path cannot traverse a cell that is not part of the square grid:
   :- path(X, Y), not cell(X, Y).

4. The path cannot bend more times than indicated by the number in a cell:
   :- bends(X, Y, N), count_bends(X, Y, M), M > N.

5. The path cannot bend between the cell marked with a white circle and the first cell with a number:
   :- no_bend(X, Y), path(X1, Y1), first_number(X1, Y1), adjacent(X, Y, X1, Y1).

6. The path cannot move to a cell that is not horizontally or vertically adjacent:
   :- move(X1, Y1, X2, Y2), not adjacent(X1, Y1, X2, Y2).

7. The path cannot move diagonally:
   :- not_diagonal(X1, Y1, X2, Y2), diagonal(X1, Y1, X2, Y2).

8. The path cannot cross or intersect itself:
   :- crossed(X, Y), crossed(X1, Y1), crossed(X2, Y2), crossed(X3, Y3), intersect(X, Y, X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3, Y3).

9. The path cannot bend more times than the maximum allowed:
   :- count_bends(X, Y, M, N), M > N.

10. The path cannot intersect with the cell marked with a white circle:
    :- intersect(X, Y, X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3, Y3), white_circle(X, Y).

11. The path cannot intersect with the cell marked with a black circle:
    :- intersect(X, Y, X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3, Y3), black_circle(X, Y).

12. The path cannot intersect with a number cell:
    :- intersect(X, Y, X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3, Y3), number(X, Y, _).

Note: These constraints are based on the given problem and rules. Additional constraints may be required depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem.
