:- grayArea(X, Y), not target(_, _, _, X, Y).% The areas have valuesI apologize for the confusion. In Answer Set Programming, we don't usually define predicates in the same way as in other programming languages. Predicates are more like facts or rules that are used to represent the problem domain. 

If you want to represent that areas have values, you can simply use a predicate like this:

area_value(X, Y, Value).

This line states that there is an area at position (X, Y) with a certain Value. You don't need to use ":-" unless you are defining a rule. Please replace the values of X, Y, and Value with the actual values from your problem instance.% For each number, there is a target related to only one areaI apologize for the mistake. Here is the corrected rule:

% For each number, there is a target related to only one area
:- number(X, Y, N), target(X, Y, N, TX1, TY1), target(X, Y, N, TX2, TY2), area(TX1, TY1, _), area(TX2, TY2, _), (TX1 != TX2 ; TY1 != TY2).% Show output predicateI apologize for the mistake. The correct rule should be:

% For each number, there is a target related to only one area
:- number(X, Y, N), 2 {target(X, Y, N, TX, TY) : area(TX, TY, _)}.
