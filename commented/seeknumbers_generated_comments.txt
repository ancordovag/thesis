% Define the grid size and the coordinates of each cell.
% Define the starting cell (white circle) and the ending cell (black circle).
% Define the direction of movement: up, down, left, and right.
% Define a path from cell (X,Y) to cell (P,Q) if they are horizontally or vertically adjacent.
% Define a cell as visited if it is included in the path.
% Ensure that the path starts at the cell with the white circle and ends at the cell with the black circle.
% Ensure that the path traverses each cell exactly once.
% Ensure that the path does not cross or intersect itself.
% Define a bend in the path as a change in direction.
% Ensure that between a cell with a number N and the next cell with a number or the cell with the black circle, the path bends exactly N times.
% Ensure that the path does not bend between the cell with the white circle and the first cell with a number.
% Show output predicate.
