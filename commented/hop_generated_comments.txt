% Define the start and end points of the path.
% Define the possible directions for movement: up (0,1), down (0,-1), right (1,0), and left (-1,0).
% Define the pattern of jumps: 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, and so on.
% Define a predicate that indicates which cells are already known to be part of the path.
% Ensure that the path starts at the predefined start point.
% Ensure that the path ends at the predefined end point.
% Ensure that the path follows the pattern of jumps.
% Ensure that the path does not cross itself.
% Ensure that the path includes all the known cells.
% Ensure that the path does not include any cells that are not known to be part of the path.
% For each jump, ensure that the path lands on a cell that is in the correct direction and distance from the previous cell according to the pattern of jumps.
% Show output predicate.
