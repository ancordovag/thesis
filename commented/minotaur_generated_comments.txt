% The player can move to a cell (X,Y) from a cell (P,Q) if the cell (X,Y) is reachable from the cell (P,Q) and the Minotaur is not in the cell (X,Y).
% The Minotaur can move to a cell (X,Y) from a cell (P,Q) if the cell (X,Y) is reachable from the cell (P,Q) and the player is not in the cell (X,Y).
% The Minotaur moves towards the player by choosing the direction that decreases the Manhattan distance between them.
% If the Minotaur cannot move towards the player, it stays in its current position.
% The player reaches the goal if they are in the goal position and the Minotaur is not.
