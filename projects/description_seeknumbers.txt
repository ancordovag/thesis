Problem Description.

The task of this project is to develop an ASP encoding for the Seek Numbers puzzle.

Below you can see a Seek Numbers puzzle on the left, and its solution on the right.

Given a square grid as shown on the left side, the goal is to construct a directed path by linking horizontally or vertically adjacent cells such that:

    the path starts at the cell marked with a white circle and ends at the cell marked with a black circle,
    the path traverses each remaining cell of the square grid without ever crossing or intersecting itself,
    between a cell with a (positive) number and the next cell with a number or the cell marked with a black circle, respectively, the path bends exactly as often as the number in the first cell indicates, and
    the path does not bend between the cell marked with a white circle and the first cell with a number.

The only path satisfying these conditions for the Seek Numbers puzzle on the left is shown on the right.

To familiarize yourself with the Seek Numbers puzzle, you can try the puzzle online.


Representation in ASP.

The square grid is represented by facts of the following predicates:

cell(X,Y).   % the cell (X,Y) belongs to the grid
first(X,Y).  % the first cell of the path (marked with a white circle) is (X,Y)
final(X,Y).  % the final cell of the path (marked with a black circle) is (X,Y)
hint(X,Y,N). % the cell (X,Y) contains the hint number N

Every problem instance contains exactly one fact over first/2 and one fact over final/2.

The example shown before is represented by the following facts:

cell(1..3,1..3).
first(1,1).
final(3,3).
hint(2,1,2).
hint(2,2,2).

The solution is represented by atoms of predicate path/4:

path(X1,Y1,X2,Y2). % the path has an edge between the cells (X1,Y1) and (X2,Y2)

For instance, the solution of the example consists of the following atoms:

path(1,1,2,1) path(2,1,3,1) path(3,1,3,2) path(3,2,2,2)
path(2,2,1,2) path(1,2,1,3) path(1,3,2,3) path(2,3,3,3)
